<br>
(1) My vision for my life (including my health) is:<br>

Live a long enjoyable life. Want to be with someone, create a family,
live in suburbia, mow the grass, teach the kids to play football.<br>

Have a safe financial future.<br>

Personal ambitions? Hawaii? Devizes-Westminster? Comrades? <br>

Be fit but no desire to push any further at running, able to take on random challenges.<br>

Be a positive influence in peoples lives! <br>

Travel? Want to go to Norway fjords, South Africa, Egypt, Inca trail, walk the grand canyon.<br>

Friends? OF gatherings? Mountain biking?<br>

Family? (Josh, parents) When to see them? How often?<br>

<br>

<br>
(2) My vision for my work, career, job, and team is:<br>

Be passionate about my job. Create products to be proud of and work in
a team where we can have fun creating them. Still have a good work/life
balance.<br>

<br>
(3) My vision for my relationship and family is:<br>

Always live in a loving relationship. Be pro-active, don't live with negativity, don't let things slip through the cracks.<br>

Feel loved and give love.<br>

Don't be or feel dominated. Feel as though love is equal on both sides.<br>

Don't feel the need to create special days. It's the small things that
are important, I.e. sharing love daily, texting, smiling, being
positive with each other.<br>
